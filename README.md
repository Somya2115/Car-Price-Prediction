# Car-Price-Prediction
Used Random Forest Algorithm to gain insights from the data and built a machine learning model to predict car price.
As Random Forest cannot work with categorical variables so they are converted to dummy vaiables in the form of 0,1
A scatter plot is created to visualize the actual dataset and the predictions
Insights gained: 1)Mean Squared Error (MSE) = 4,055,759.48: Indicates average prediction errors between predicted and actual car prices.

2)Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 2,013.89: Average prediction deviation of $2,013.89 from actual car prices.

3)R-squared (R2) = 0.941: Model explains about 94.1% of variance in car prices.

4)High Explained Variance: R2 score of 0.941 shows a good fit and captures significant price variability.
